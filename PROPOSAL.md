# Proposal for Code Improvements

This proposal outlines several improvements for the repository:

- **C1: Missing Dockerfile:** A Dockerfile should be added to containerize the application for easier deployment and reproducibility.
- **C2: Dependencies:** A requirements.txt file (or similar) should be created to manage Python dependencies.
- **C3: General Code Audit:** A general code audit should be performed to identify potential syntax errors, logical bugs, and hardcoded secrets.
