## Proposal

This proposal addresses the missing Dockerfile and improves logging in the application.

**C1: Add Dockerfile**
A Dockerfile will be added to containerize the application, simplifying deployment and ensuring consistency across different environments.

**C2: Improve Logging**
Enhanced logging will be implemented in `aggregate.py` and `api.py` to provide better insights into the application's behavior and facilitate debugging.
