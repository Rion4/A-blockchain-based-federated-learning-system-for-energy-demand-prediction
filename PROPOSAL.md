## Proposal for Standardization

The following changes will be made to standardize the repository:

-   [C1] Add a `Dockerfile` for containerization.
-   [C2] Add a `.env.example` file to provide a template for environment variables.
-   [C3] Replace `print()` statements with proper logging in `aggregate.py`.
-   [C4] Ensure `aggregate.py` uses environment variables for configuration.
-   [C5] Replace `print()` statements with proper logging in `api.py`.
-   [C6] Ensure `api.py` uses environment variables for configuration.
-   [C7] Replace `print()` statements with proper logging in `submit_weights.py`.
-   [C8] Ensure `submit_weights.py` uses environment variables for configuration.
