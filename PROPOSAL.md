## PROPOSAL

*   **C1: Security Enhancement - Update Dependencies:** Analyze `package.json` for outdated dependencies with known vulnerabilities and propose updates.
*   **C2: Codebase Refactor - Simplify `aggregate.py`:** Review `aggregate.py` for potential simplifications and optimizations, focusing on reducing complexity and improving readability.
*   **C3: Frontend Optimization - Optimize Data Loading:** Investigate how the data is loaded and displayed in `index.html` and the associated JavaScript files, and propose optimizations for faster loading and rendering of the energy demand predictions.
