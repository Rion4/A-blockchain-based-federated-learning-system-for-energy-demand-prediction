C1: **Enhance Data Handling** - Implement robust error handling and validation for CSV data loading in `aggregate.py` to prevent crashes due to malformed data.
C2: **Improve Smart Contract Interaction** - Implement better error handling and logging around smart contract interactions in `api.py` to diagnose and recover from blockchain-related issues.
C3: **Implement CI/CD Pipeline** - Implement a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment, improving code quality and deployment speed.
